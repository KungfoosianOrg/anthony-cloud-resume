My cloud resume following the steps from the Cloud Resume Challenge


4/16/24: Finished chunk 1, including DevOps module: simple resume layout w/ Bootstrap CDN embedded in HTML, CI/CD with GitHub Actions to AWS, using GitHub OIDC to authN. AWS infrastructure to host static website (S3, CloudFront, Route53 for custom domain) and supporting resources are run by CloudFormation (IaC). However, CloudFormation stacks are currently updated manually with any template updates.
